MS  - An NADPH-dependent P450 enzyme that plays an essential role in the
      sterol biosynthetic pathway by catalyzing the demethylation of
      14-methyl sterols such as lanosterol. The enzyme acts via the repeated
      hydroxylation of the 14-methyl group, resulting in its stepwise
      conversion into an alcohol, an aldehyde and then a carboxylate, which
      is removed as formic acid. Sterol 14-demethylase is an unusual
      cytochrome P450 enzyme in that it is found in a broad variety of
      organisms including ANIMALS; PLANTS; FUNGI; and protozoa.

      decaying wavelet series from the original prototype wavelet, called
      the mother wavelet. This mathematical algorithm has been adopted
      widely in biomedical disciplines for data and signal processing in
      noise removal and audio/image compression (e.g., EEG and MRI).
