UI  - D000067559

MS  - Diagnosed when there are specific deficits in an individual’s ability to perceive or process information efficiently and accurately. This  disorder first manifests during the years of formal schooling and is characterized by persistent and impairing difficulties with learning foundational academic skills in reading, writing, and/or math. The individual’s performance of the affected academic skills is well below average for age, or acceptable performance levels are achieved only with extraordinary effort. Specific learning disorder may occur in individuals identified as intellectually gifted and manifest only when the learning demands or assessment procedures (e.g., timed tests) pose barriers that cannot be overcome by their innate intelligence and compensatory strategies. For all individuals, specific learning disorder can produce lifelong impairments in activities dependent on the skills, including occupational performance. (from DSM-V)

The one-step secretion is carried out by a channel that passes from the CYTOPLASM, through the inner membrane, PERIPLASMIC SPACE, and outer membrane, to the EXTRACELLULAR SPACE. The specificity of type I secretions systems are determined by the specificity of the three subcomponents forming the channel - an ATP transporter (ATP-BINDING CASSETTE TRANSPORTERS); a membrane fusion protein (MEMBRANE FUSION PROTEINS); and an outer membrane protein (BACTERIAL OUTER MEMBRANE PROTEINS.)
