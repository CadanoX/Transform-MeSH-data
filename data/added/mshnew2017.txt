Functionally, it is associated with roles in cell differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis. Specifically, it regulates the organization of apical plasma membrane in epithelial cells, disk morphogenesis during early retinal development, MAPK and Akt signaling pathways, and in cholesterol metabolism.

MS  - Myelin proteins that are expressed as three isoforms: Nogo-A, Nogo-B, and Nogo-C. These share a C-terminal reticulon homology domain (RHD), consisting of two hydrophobic membrane domains flanking a 66 amino acid (Nogo-66) hydrophilic region. A long transmembrane region allows conformations that either span the entire membrane or fold into a hairpin conformation. Nogo inhibits NEURITE outgrowth and modulates wiring and the restriction of SYNAPTIC PLASTICITY in the adult central nervous system. It also regulates neurite fasciculation, branching, and extension in the developing nervous system.

MS  - A perilipin that functions in LIPOGENESIS; LIPOLYSIS; and fatty acid oxidation in BROWN ADIPOSE TISSUE; heart, liver, and skeletal muscle. It recruits MITOCHONDRIA to the surface of LIPID DROPLETS where it functions in both the storage of fatty acids as TRIGLYCERIDES, and their release for mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation in response to metabolic needs.

MS  - A family of vertebrate and insect lipid droplet associated proteins. They consist of a conserved N-terminal PAT domain (an alpha-helical region of about 110 amino acids), an 11-mer repeat region, and lipid-binding hydrophobic regions or 4-helix bundles near their C-termini. Perilipins transiently or constitutively localize to LIPID DROPLETS in ADIPOCYTES and FOAM CELLS, especially in regions adjacent to the PLASMA MEMBRANE and ENDOPLASMIC RECTICULUM. They are critical for lipid droplet synthesis and homeostasis as well as the regulation of lipid metabolism. Genetic variations in perilipins are associated with ATHEROSCLEROSIS; OBESITY; and DIABETES MELLITUS.
